    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Steak</strong> is the perfect emobidement of what it means to be american.
        Simple, powerful, strong. Afterall, a proper steak does not take much to perfect.
        Realistically, all you have to do is let the meat speak for itself. Just remember to never
        cook a steak well done because it'll be the last thing you ever eat. Respectfully.
