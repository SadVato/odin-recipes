    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Pizza </strong> is the classic dish that quite literally everyone knows
        and loves. It a glance, its one of the easist dishes to assemble. A bread base covered
        with a tomato sauce, topped with cheese. Yet, this combination leaves a near infinite
        amount of possibliites with additional toppings.

    </p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add sugar and yeast to lukewarm water; stir thoroughly until dissolved.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, mix together flour and salt. Then add olive oil and water mixture to center of the flour and mix together until well incorporated.</li>
            <li>Turn out dough onto a floured work surface and knead until dough is smooth, but firm. Transfer back to floured bowl, cover with kitchen towel, and store in a warm, dry place for approx. 1 – 2 hours until dough has doubled in volume.</li>
            <li>Place pizza stone in unheated oven, then preheat to 250°C/480°F.</li>
            <li>Remove dough from bowl. On a floured work surface, flatten out to approx. the size of the pizza stone. Transfer to a pizza paddle.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together tomato purée, olive oil, and salt. Roughly tear up basil leaves and add them to sauce. Spread a thin layer over pizza, transfer to pizza stone, and bake in preheated oven at 250°C/480°F for approx. 6 – 7 min.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cut cherry tomatoes in half and buffalo mozzarella into thin slices. Remove pizza from oven; place tomatoes and mozzarella on top, return to oven and bake for another 6 – 7 min. until cheese is melted and crust is golden.</li>
            <li>Garnish pizza with fresh basil leaves. Drizzle with high quality olive oil before serving, if desired. Enjoy!</li>
